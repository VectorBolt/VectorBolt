**Currently:** 
- ☢️ Working on the [RaX Collaboration](https://www.garciaruizlab.com/copy-of-neptune-project) at Harvard & MIT, where we're working on laser cooling and trapping radioactive molecules to probe fundamental physics.

**Previously:**
- 🔭 Worked on the Gigapixel-class Balloon-borne Imaging Telescope ([GigaBIT](https://www.gigabitastro.com/)), a near-space telescope that will have 80x Hubble's field-of-view, with comparable resolution.
- ⚙️ Worked on the mechanical engineering team of [Blue Sky Solar Racing](https://www.blueskysolar.org/), a UofT design team building solar cars to race across Australia.
- 💡 Worked at the Optical Materials and Devices lab at the National University of Singapore (NUS), using lasers to measure the thicknesses of silicon wafers with micrometer resolution using low-coherence interferometry.
